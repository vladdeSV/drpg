# drpg
Primitive, but working, RPG

##### Backstory
So my teacher told me to look up the D language, and after some time my friend told me to make an RPG or whatever.
And BÃ„M that's what I'm doing it now.

##What is it
DRPG is a work in progress attempt at a RPG game, with no clear goal in mind.

##Did you just find this randomly and want to contribute?
My best guess you were on Github and just searched for D projects, and saw the letters RPG. I am #nub at programming, so the code should be pretty understandable. If you feel like you want to do something with it or whatever please do! :)
