Primitive, but working, RPG

You are the letter **p** in the country Letterland. Your goal is to collect the rest of the alphabet to be able to defeat the boss.

##Did you just find this randomly and want to contribute?
My best guess you were on Github and just searched for D projects, and saw the letters RPG. I am #nub at programming, so the code should be pretty understandable. If you feel like you want to do something with it or whatever please do! :)
